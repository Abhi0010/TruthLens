# TruthLens Knowledge Base - Common Misinformation & Scam Topics

## Vaccines

COVID-19 vaccines were developed and authorized after rigorous clinical trials. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed over 90% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. Vaccine side effects are typically mild and temporary. The claim that vaccines contain microchips is false and has been debunked by health authorities. Vaccines do not alter DNA. mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response.

The flu vaccine is recommended annually. Childhood vaccines have dramatically reduced diseases like measles and polio. The link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked. Multiple studies found no causal connection. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 paper was retracted and found to be fraudulent.

## Elections

Election systems in the United States use multiple layers of security including paper ballots, audits, and verification. Widespread voter fraud is extremely rare. The 2020 U.S. presidential election was certified by all 50 states. Claims of massive fraud have been debunked by courts, audits, and election officials. Mail-in voting has been used for decades with safeguards.

## Crypto and Financial Scams

Cryptocurrency investment scams often promise guaranteed returns or "too good to be true" profits. Legitimate investments never guarantee returns. If someone asks you to pay in gift cards, Bitcoin, or wire transfer for an "opportunity," it is almost certainly a scam. The IRS does not contact taxpayers by email or phone demanding immediate payment. Scammers impersonate the IRS, banks, and tech support.

Pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes promise high returns from recruiting others. They are illegal and eventually collapse. Be wary of "urgent" investment opportunities. Legitimate companies do not pressure you to act within 24 hours. Never share your password, PIN, or SSN with anyone who contacts you unsolicited.

## AI Deepfakes and Synthetic Media

Deepfakes are AI-generated videos or audio that can impersonate real people. They have been used in misinformation campaigns. Not all viral videos are real—check the source. Synthetic media is improving rapidly. Be skeptical of sensational videos, especially those shared without clear attribution. Fact-check before sharing.

AI-generated text can be hard to detect. It often uses generic phrasing and uniform structure. Look for sources and verify claims independently.

## Urgent Scam Patterns

Scammers create false urgency: "Your account will be closed in 24 hours." "Act now or lose your prize." Legitimate organizations give you time to verify. The IRS never demands immediate payment by gift card. Banks do not ask you to "verify" your account by clicking a link in an email. Tech support scams claim your computer is infected and ask for remote access or payment.

Phishing emails often have generic greetings like "Dear Customer." They may contain spelling errors and suspicious links. Hover over links to see the real URL before clicking. When in doubt, contact the organization through their official website, not through the message.

## Health Misinformation

Miracle cures and "they don't want you to know" claims are red flags. If a treatment were proven effective, it would be widely adopted. Be skeptical of health claims that contradict medical consensus without strong evidence. Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs. "Natural" does not mean safe.

Cancer cannot be cured by baking soda or essential oils. These claims have been debunked. Always consult healthcare providers for medical advice.

## General Fact-Checking

Correlation does not imply causation. A study linking two things does not prove one causes the other. Check if information comes from peer-reviewed sources. Social media posts are not reliable sources. Look for multiple independent confirmations of surprising claims. Old images and videos are often repurposed with false captions—reverse image search can help verify.
